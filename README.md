### Custom Animation Tool
This custom Unity editor tool allowed us to directly configure hitboxes and other gameplay effects, and the custom animator was 20% faster over Mecanim (which was previously used).

### Custom Level Editing Tool
To increase the speed of curating rooms for dungeons, I implemented a Unity editor tool to directly modify Scriptable Objects with room data on enemy spawn points, props and other features.

### Some Of My Proudest Drawings
I spent a lot of time drawing assets for the game, and some of my proudest drawings were created through this process (including the banner at the top of this README).
